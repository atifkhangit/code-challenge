Design:
1. The important design decision was to have a trade off between storage overhead and retrieval overhead while ingesting and processing. The design pushes the complexity towards storage part while keeping calculation of Customer LTV faster.

2. The Customer object has an additional flag attribute 'active' indicating the latest customer information. The latest record will have the active flag as 1.

3. The data structures used for Customers and Orders are capable of storing the history of the respective data as both receives verb 'UPDATE'.

4. The Order object also has additional flag attribute 'active' indicating the latest order for the order id.

5. Individual orders, site visits are stored in HashMap based on the keys which are the week start date for the particular event time. The DateCalculator class returns the first day of the week for start date.


Future Improvement:
In the future the code can be improved by pushing the storage of ingested data to an in-memory database or a relational database.
